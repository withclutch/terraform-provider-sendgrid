# sendgrid_event_webhook (Resource)

Manages SendGrid Event Webhook settings. Event Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about email events such as deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and more. Multiple webhooks can be created per account.

**Important Notes:**

- Multiple event webhooks can be created per SendGrid account
- Each webhook must have a unique URL
- The maximum number of webhooks depends on your SendGrid plan
- Event types require specific tracking settings to be enabled:
  - `open` and `click` events require Open Tracking and Click Tracking
  - `unsubscribe`, `group_resubscribe`, and `group_unsubscribe` require Subscription Tracking
- Use `friendly_name` to help identify your webhook (available in SendGrid dashboard)
- OAuth authentication is optional but recommended for enhanced security
- Signature verification can be enabled for webhook request verification

## Example Usage

### Basic Event Webhook

```terraform
resource "sendgrid_event_webhook" "basic" {
  enabled       = true
  url           = "https://api.myapp.com/sendgrid/events"
  friendly_name = "Production Event Webhook"

  # Basic email events
  delivered   = true
  bounce      = true
  dropped     = true
  spam_report = true
  unsubscribe = true

  # Engagement events (requires tracking enabled)
  open  = true
  click = true

  # Processing events
  processed = true
  deferred  = true

  # Group events (requires subscription tracking)
  group_resubscribe = true
  group_unsubscribe = true
}
```

### Multiple Webhooks

```terraform
# Development webhook
resource "sendgrid_event_webhook" "dev" {
  enabled       = true
  url           = "https://dev.myapp.com/sendgrid/events"
  friendly_name = "Development Webhook"

  delivered = true
  bounce    = true
  dropped   = true
}

# Production webhook
resource "sendgrid_event_webhook" "prod" {
  enabled       = true
  url           = "https://prod.myapp.com/sendgrid/events"
  friendly_name = "Production Webhook"

  delivered     = true
  bounce        = true
  dropped       = true
  spam_report   = true
  open          = true
  click         = true
}
```

### Using for_each

```terraform
locals {
  webhooks = {
    dev = {
      url  = "https://dev.myapp.com/webhook"
      name = "Development"
    }
    staging = {
      url  = "https://staging.myapp.com/webhook"
      name = "Staging"
    }
    prod = {
      url  = "https://prod.myapp.com/webhook"
      name = "Production"
    }
  }
}

resource "sendgrid_event_webhook" "webhook" {
  for_each = local.webhooks

  enabled       = true
  url           = each.value.url
  friendly_name = "${each.value.name} Webhook"

  delivered = true
  bounce    = true
  dropped   = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates if the event webhook is enabled.
- `url` (String) The public URL where you would like SendGrid to POST the data events from your email. Any emails sent with the given hostname provided (whose MX records have been updated to point to SendGrid) will be eventd and POSTed to this URL.

### Optional

- `bounce` (Boolean) Receiving server could not or would not accept message.
- `click` (Boolean) Recipient clicked on a link within the message. You need to enable Click Tracking for getting this type of event.
- `deferred` (Boolean) Recipient's email server temporarily rejected message.
- `delivered` (Boolean) Message has been successfully delivered to the receiving server.
- `dropped` (Boolean) You may see the following drop reasons: Invalid SMTPAPI header, Spam Content (if spam checker app enabled), Unsubscribed Address, Bounced Address, Spam Reporting Address, Invalid, Recipient List over Package Quota.
- `friendly_name` (String) Friendly name for the webhook to help you identify it.
- `group_resubscribe` (Boolean) Recipient resubscribes to specific group by updating preferences. You need to enable Subscription Tracking for getting this type of event.
- `group_unsubscribe` (Boolean) Recipient unsubscribe from specific group, by either direct link or updating preferences. You need to enable Subscription Tracking for getting this type of event.
- `oauth_client_id` (String) The client ID Twilio SendGrid sends to your OAuth server or service provider to generate an OAuth access token.
- `oauth_client_secret` (String, Sensitive) This secret is needed only once to create an access token. SendGrid will store this secret, allowing you to update your Client ID and Token URL without passing the secret to SendGrid again. When passing data in this field, you must also include the oauth_client_id and oauth_token_url fields.
- `oauth_token_url` (String) The URL where Twilio SendGrid sends the Client ID and Client Secret to generate an access token. This should be your OAuth server or service provider. When passing data in this field, you must also include the oauth_client_id field.
- `open` (Boolean) Recipient has opened the HTML message. You need to enable Open Tracking for getting this type of event.
- `processed` (Boolean) Message has been received and is ready to be delivered.
- `signed` (Boolean) Should the event webhook use signing?
- `spam_report` (Boolean) Recipient marked a message as spam.
- `unsubscribe` (Boolean) Recipient clicked on message's subscription management link. You need to enable Subscription Tracking for getting this type of event.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the event webhook.
- `public_key` (String) The public key used to sign the event webhook. Only present if 'signed' is true

## Import

Event webhooks can be imported using their webhook ID:

```shell
terraform import sendgrid_event_webhook.example <webhook-id>
```

To find your webhook ID, use the SendGrid API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/webhooks/event/settings/all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY"
```

## Additional Information

### Event Types

The following event types are available:

- **delivered**: Message successfully delivered to receiving server
- **processed**: Message received by SendGrid and ready for delivery
- **dropped**: Message not delivered (spam, invalid address, etc.)
- **deferred**: Recipient's email server temporarily rejected message
- **bounce**: Receiving server permanently rejected message
- **open**: Recipient opened the HTML message (requires Open Tracking)
- **click**: Recipient clicked a link (requires Click Tracking)
- **spam_report**: Recipient marked message as spam
- **unsubscribe**: Recipient clicked subscription management link
- **group_unsubscribe**: Recipient unsubscribed from specific group
- **group_resubscribe**: Recipient resubscribed to specific group

### Security

For enhanced security, you can:
1. Enable OAuth authentication by providing `oauth_client_id`, `oauth_client_secret`, and `oauth_token_url`
2. Enable signature verification using the `signed` field
3. Use the `public_key` (computed) for webhook payload verification
