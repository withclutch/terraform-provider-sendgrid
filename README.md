### Building

```bash
go build -o terraform-provider-sendgrid
```

### Testing

The provider includes both unit tests and acceptance tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run acceptance tests (requires SENDGRID_API_KEY)
make testacc
```

**Note**: Test coverage is primarily achieved through acceptance tests against the real SendGrid API. Current coverage: ~44% (standard for Terraform providers with external API dependencies).

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing instructions.
